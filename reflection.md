# Reflection on Environment Setup

Setting up the Django environment came with some challenges, especially around configuring the virtual environment and correctly installing Django. Initially, activating the virtual environment on Windows PowerShell required changing security settings to permit script execution. Installing Django and verifying its version ensured the correct dependencies were in place. Running the development server involved troubleshooting port issues and carefully following Djangoâ€™s directory structure. Setting up Git and connecting to the remote GitHub repository required learning about Git commands and authentication.
I also faced challenges committing my files to the GitHub repository. The Git index.lock error appeared due to a previous interrupted Git process, which I resolved by manually deleting the lock file. I learned to set the Git user name and email to avoid commit errors. At one point, pushing was rejected because my local branch was behind the remote, which I fixed by pulling and rebasing before pushing again. These experiences deepened my understanding of version control and source management.
I overcame each obstacle through documentation review and trial-and-error, which boosted my confidence in managing Python projects and preparing for future Django application development.
